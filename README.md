# GDW_Y3_-_PJT
Repo: https://github.com/mecha-rm/GDW_Y3-PJT

Repository for the Outkasts game development project for the fall 2020 and winter 2021 term. Unity is the engine being used for this project.
Unity Version: 2020.1.10f1

Originally, a seperate repository was used for the Unity project and its DLLs.
Said projects have been merged into one, with DLL source code being found in the "Native C++" folder.'

This is a capture the flag type game where the player that holds the flag for the longest wins.
It is intended to have online multiplayer for up to 4 players.

Use 'Free Roam' mode to roam the stages in single player mode.
Use 'Online Mode' to join a lobby and start a match.
	- NOTE: requires the sharing of the friendcode.
	

NOTE: the initial submission date for this program has passed.
However, additions are still going to be made to fix some issues.
The main problem being fixed is getting the online lobby to work, but related elements may be changed to allow for that. To see the build that was submitted for the winter 2021 term, use the following achived link.
